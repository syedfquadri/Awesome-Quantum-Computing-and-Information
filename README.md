        <li><strong>Title</strong>:<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.3376.pdf"> Quantum Proofs for Classical Theorems</a>.<br><strong>Abstract</strong>: Alongside the development of quantum algorithms and quantum complexity theory in recent years, quantum techniques have also proved instrumental in obtaining results in diverse classical (non-quantum) areas, such as coding theory, communication complexity, and polynomial approximations. In this paper we survey these results and the quantum toolbox they use.</li>

        <li><strong>Title</strong>: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23474">Quantum Machine Learning</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09347">[ArXiv]</a><br><strong>Thesis</strong>: Fuelled by increasing computer power and algorithmic advances, machine learning techniques have become powerful tools for finding patterns in data. Quantum systems produce atypical patterns that classical systems are thought not to produce efficiently, so it is reasonable to postulate that quantum computers may outperform classical computers on machine learning tasks. The field of quantum machine learning explores how to devise and implement quantum software that could enable machine learning that is faster than that of classical computers. Recent work has produced quantum algorithms that could act as the building blocks of machine learning programs, but the hardware and software challenges are still considerable. </li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong>: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/npjqi201523">Quantum algorithms: an overview</a><br><strong>Abstract</strong>: Quantum computers are designed to outperform standard computers by running quantum algorithms. Areas in which quantum algorithms can be applied include cryptography, search and optimisation, simulation of quantum systems and solving large systems of linear equations. Here we briefly survey some known quantum algorithms, with an emphasis on a broad overview of their applications rather than their technical details. We include a discussion of recent developments and near-term applications of quantum algorithms.</li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02266">An Artificial Neuron Implemented on an Actual Quantum Processor</a><br><strong>Abstract</strong>: Artificial neural networks are the heart of machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence protocols. Historically, the simplest implementation of an artificial neuron traces back to the classical Rosenblatt's `perceptron', but its long term practical applications may be hindered by the fast scaling up of computational complexity, especially relevant for the training of multilayered perceptron networks. Here we introduce a quantum information-based algorithm implementing the quantum computer version of a perceptron, which shows exponential advantage in encoding resources over alternative realizations. We experimentally test a few qubits version of this model on an actual small-scale quantum processor, which gives remarkably good answers against the expected results. We show that this quantum model of a perceptron can be used as an elementary nonlinear classifier of simple patterns, as a first step towards practical training of artificial quantum neural networks to be efficiently implemented on near-term quantum processing hardware.</li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00011">Why now is the right time to study quantum computing</a><br><strong>Abstract</strong>: Quantum computing is a good way to justify difficult physics experiments. But until quantum computers are built, do computer scientists need to know anything about quantum information? In fact, quantum computing is not merely a recipe for new computing devices, but a new way of looking at the world that has been astonishingly intellectually productive. In this article, I'll talk about where quantum computing came from, what it is, and what we can learn from it.</li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09729">A Universal Training Algorithm for Quantum Deep Learning</a><br><strong>Abstract</strong>: We introduce the Backwards Quantum Propagation of Phase errors (Baqprop) principle, a central theme upon which we construct multiple universal optimization heuristics for training both parametrized quantum circuits and classical deep neural networks on a quantum computer. Baqprop encodes error information in relative phases of a quantum wavefunction defined over the space of network parameters; it can be thought of as the unification of the phase kickback principle of quantum computation and of the backpropagation algorithm from classical deep learning. We propose two core heuristics which leverage Baqprop for quantum-enhanced optimization of network parameters: Quantum Dynamical Descent (QDD) and Momentum Measurement Gradient Descent (MoMGrad). QDD uses simulated quantum coherent dynamics for parameter optimization, allowing for quantum tunneling through the hypothesis space landscape. MoMGrad leverages Baqprop to estimate gradients and thereby perform gradient descent on the parameter landscape; it can be thought of as the quantum-classical analogue of QDD. In addition to these core optimization strategies, we propose various methods for parallelization, regularization, and meta-learning as augmentations to MoMGrad and QDD. We introduce several quantum-coherent adaptations of canonical classical feedforward neural networks, and study how Baqprop can be used to optimize such networks. We develop multiple applications of parametric circuit learning for quantum data, and show how to perform Baqprop in each case. One such application allows for the training of hybrid quantum-classical neural-circuit networks, via the seamless integration of Baqprop with classical backpropagation. Finally, for a representative subset of these proposed applications, we demonstrate the training of these networks via numerical simulations of implementations of QDD and MoMGrad.</li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08641">Quantum generative adversarial networks</a><br><strong>Abstract</strong>: Quantum machine learning is expected to be one of the first potential general-purpose applications of near-term quantum devices. A major recent breakthrough in classical machine learning is the notion of generative adversarial training, where the gradients of a discriminator model are used to train a separate generative model. In this work and a companion paper, we extend adversarial training to the quantum domain and show how to construct generative adversarial networks using quantum circuits. Furthermore, we also show how to compute gradients -- a key element in generative adversarial network training -- using another quantum circuit. We give an example of a simple practical circuit ansatz to parametrize quantum machine learning models and perform a simple numerical experiment to demonstrate that quantum generative adversarial networks can be trained successfully.</li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09139">Quantum generative adversarial learning</a><br><strong>Abstract</strong>: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) represent a powerful tool for classical machine learning: a generator tries to create statistics for data that mimics those of a true data set, while a discriminator tries to discriminate between the true and fake data. The learning process for generator and discriminator can be thought of as an adversarial game, and under reasonable assumptions, the game converges to the point where the generator generates the same statistics as the true data and the discriminator is unable to discriminate between the true and the generated data. This paper introduces the notion of quantum generative adversarial networks (QuGANs), where the data consists either of quantum states, or of classical data, and the generator and discriminator are equipped with quantum information processors. We show that the unique fixed point of the quantum adversarial game also occurs when the generator produces the same statistics as the data. Since quantum systems are intrinsically probabilistic the proof of the quantum case is different from - and simpler than - the classical case. We show that when the data consists of samples of measurements made on high-dimensional spaces, quantum adversarial networks may exhibit an exponential advantage over classical adversarial networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong>:<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.3828"> Quantum reinforcement learning</a><br><strong>Abstract</strong>: The key approaches for machine learning, especially learning in unknown probabilistic environments are new representations and computation mechanisms. In this paper, a novel quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) method is proposed by combining quantum theory and reinforcement learning (RL). Inspired by the state superposition principle and quantum parallelism, a framework of value updating algorithm is introduced. The state (action) in traditional RL is identified as the eigen state (eigen action) in QRL. The state (action) set can be represented with a quantum superposition state and the eigen state (eigen action) can be obtained by randomly observing the simulated quantum state according to the collapse postulate of quantum measurement. The probability of the eigen action is determined by the probability amplitude, which is parallelly updated according to rewards. Some related characteristics of QRL such as convergence, optimality and balancing between exploration and exploitation are also analyzed, which shows that this approach makes a good tradeoff between exploration and exploitation using the probability amplitude and can speed up learning through the quantum parallelism. To evaluate the performance and practicability of QRL, several simulated experiments are given and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of QRL algorithm for some complex problems. The present work is also an effective exploration on the application of quantum computation to artificial intelligence.</li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10068">Quantum machine learning for data scientists</a><br><strong>Abstract</strong>: This text aims to present and explain quantum machine learning algorithms to a data scientist in an accessible and consistent way. The algorithms and equations presented are not written in rigorous mathematical fashion, instead, the pressure is put on examples and step by step explanation of difficult topics. This contribution gives an overview of selected quantum machine learning algorithms, however there is also a method of scores extraction for quantum PCA algorithm proposed as well as a new cost function in feed-forward quantum neural networks is introduced. The text is divided into four parts: the first part explains the basic quantum theory, then quantum computation and quantum computer architecture are explained in section two. The third part presents quantum algorithms which will be used as subroutines in quantum machine learning algorithms. Finally, the fourth section describes quantum machine learning algorithms with the use of knowledge accumulated in previous parts.</li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02036">Quantum Boltzmann Machine</a><br><strong>Abstract</strong>: Inspired by the success of Boltzmann Machines based on classical Boltzmann distribution, we propose a new machine learning approach based on quantum Boltzmann distribution of a transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian. Due to the non-commutative nature of quantum mechanics, the training process of the Quantum Boltzmann Machine (QBM) can become nontrivial. We circumvent the problem by introducing bounds on the quantum probabilities. This allows us to train the QBM efficiently by sampling. We show examples of QBM training with and without the bound, using exact diagonalization, and compare the results with classical Boltzmann training. We also discuss the possibility of using quantum annealing processors like D-Wave for QBM training and application. </li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05779">Quantum Variational Autoencoder</a><br><strong>Abstract</strong>: Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models with the salient ability to perform inference. Here, we introduce a \emph{quantum variational autoencoder} (QVAE): a VAE whose latent generative process is implemented as a quantum Boltzmann machine (QBM). We show that our model can be trained end-to-end by maximizing a well-defined loss-function: a "quantum" lower-bound to a variational approximation of the log-likelihood. We use quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to train and evaluate the performance of QVAEs. To achieve the best performance, we first create a VAE platform with discrete latent space generated by a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST dataset when compared against similar approaches that only involve discrete variables in the generative process. We consider QVAEs with a smaller number of latent units to be able to perform QMC simulations, which are computationally expensive. We show that QVAEs can be trained effectively in regimes where quantum effects are relevant despite training via the quantum bound. Our findings open the way to the use of quantum computers to train QVAEs to achieve competitive performance for generative models. Placing a QBM in the latent space of a VAE leverages the full potential of current and next-generation quantum computers as sampling devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08561">Quantum machine learning: a classical perspective</a><br><strong>Abstract</strong>: Recently, increased computational power and data availability, as well as algorithmic advances, have led machine learning techniques to impressive results in regression, classification, data-generation and reinforcement learning tasks. Despite these successes, the proximity to the physical limits of chip fabrication alongside the increasing size of datasets are motivating a growing number of researchers to explore the possibility of harnessing the power of quantum computation to speed-up classical machine learning algorithms. Here we review the literature in quantum machine learning and discuss perspectives for a mixed readership of classical machine learning and quantum computation experts. Particular emphasis will be placed on clarifying the limitations of quantum algorithms, how they compare with their best classical counterparts and why quantum resources are expected to provide advantages for learning problems. Learning in the presence of noise and certain computationally hard problems in machine learning are identified as promising directions for the field. Practical questions, like how to upload classical data into quantum form, will also be addressed.</li>
        <li><strong>Title</strong>: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06002">Classification with Quantum Neural Networks on Near Term Processors</a><br><strong>Abstract</strong>: We introduce a quantum neural network, QNN, that can represent labeled data, classical or quantum, and be trained by supervised learning. The quantum circuit consists of a sequence of parameter dependent unitary transformations which acts on an input quantum state. For binary classification a single Pauli operator is measured on a designated readout qubit. The measured output is the quantum neural network's predictor of the binary label of the input state. First we look at classifying classical data sets which consist of n-bit strings with binary labels. The input quantum state is an n-bit computational basis state corresponding to a sample string. We show how to design a circuit made from two qubit unitaries that can correctly represent the label of any Boolean function of n bits. For certain label functions the circuit is exponentially long. We introduce parameter dependent unitaries that can be adapted by supervised learning of labeled data. We study an example of real world data consisting of downsampled images of handwritten digits each of which has been labeled as one of two distinct digits. We show through classical simulation that parameters can be found that allow the QNN to learn to correctly distinguish the two data sets. We then discuss presenting the data as quantum superpositions of computational basis states corresponding to different label values. Here we show through simulation that learning is possible. We consider using our QNN to learn the label of a general quantum state. By example we show that this can be done. Our work is exploratory and relies on the classical simulation of small quantum systems. The QNN proposed here was designed with near-term quantum processors in mind. Therefore it will be possible to run this QNN on a near term gate model quantum computer where its power can be explored beyond what can be explored with simulation.</li>
